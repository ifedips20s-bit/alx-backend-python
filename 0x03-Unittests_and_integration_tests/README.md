# My Project

This project demonstrates proper Python testing using **unit tests** and **integration tests**.

- `utils.py`: Utility functions with pure logic.
- `client.py`: Simulates a client fetching data from external endpoints.
- `fixtures.py`: Provides sample data for testing.
- `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests.

## Running Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
